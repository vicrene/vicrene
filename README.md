Hi all, Iâ€™m @vicrene.

Growing up as a first-gen, Mexican-American, in a small town, I was exposed to a limited range of career options. However, it wasn't until high school that I discovered my passion for data and analytical skills. I realized that data plays a crucial role in decision-making, and my aptitude for analytical skills and resilience led me to where I am today.

I have always been driven to improve and advance in my career. I understand that frequent job changes can be viewed negatively, but I see it as an opportunity to showcase my adaptability, quick learning skills, and desire for new challenges. By highlighting specific achievements and transferable skills gained from each position, I aim to present it as a positive attribute that sets me apart in the job market.

As a data analyst, I have a diverse professional background and a track record of adding value through research and analysis. My technical background and drive to continuously improve make me a valuable team player. I believe in the power of effective communication and am seeking new opportunities to utilize my skills and experience to grow in a stable and supportive environment for the long run.

Feel free to shoot me a message at renegarciajr5@gmail.com.
