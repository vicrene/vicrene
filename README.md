## Hi all, Iâ€™m @vicrene.

####  Growing up as a first-gen, Mexican-American, in a small town, I was exposed to a limited range of career options. However, it wasn't until high school that I discovered my passion for data and analytical skills. I realized that data plays a crucial role in decision-making, and my aptitude for analytical skills and resilience led me to where I am today.

#### As a data analyst, I have a diverse professional background and a track record of adding value through research and analysis. My technical background and drive to continuously improve make me a valuable team player. I believe in the power of effective communication and am seeking new opportunities to utilize my skills and experience to grow in a stable and supportive environment for the long run. 

##### When not job-hunting or doing small data viz projects, I'm usually reading towards my yearly book goal, training for half/full marathons, or gaming.


### I'm currently actively looking and immediately available for opportunities in Data Analysis, so feel free to shoot me a message at renegarciajr5@gmail.com or reach out on LinkedIn. Thanks!
