Hi all, Iâ€™m @vicrene and I'm a new learner in the software developing/engineering world. 
While I have a BS and MS degree for Geological Sciences,
the act of programming has always interested me and I've been on this coding journey since July 2021. 
I'm extremely excited to learn more about any projects that I can contribute in HTML/CSS/JS.

Feel free to shoot me a message at victor_ep96@hotmail.com and on Twitter @tech_victorg
